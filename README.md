# Meteo-Visualize-analysis
Meteo-Visualize-analysis will be a package in Python for reading, visualizing and performing calculations with weather data,
including station observations as well as rectilinear/curvilinear grid data(i.e. RCM, WRF, NARR), 
including time series as well as meteorology field,
including climate statistics, interpolation, regriding and so on base on scipy, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn and so on,
including visuallizing data on a map, clipping a figure based on shapefile, smoothing and so on.

She is in a very early stage of development now.
